# Rock in the cave

Rock in the cave is a 2d platformer build in java with libgdx. It works on a
self written engine, deploys on android, ios, web and desktop. It was 
presented at grepit 9 (2016) where me and @alexnaiman won first prize for gaming.


```It was a transition period from c# to java, a strange code style may preset itself in the project :)```
